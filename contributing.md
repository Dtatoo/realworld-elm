# Contributing Guide

- If you're not using [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format), you should be using.

- Please try to follow [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) guide on commit messages. It won't be enforced on code review, but it helps a lot on reading old commits.


At this first moment we're just building structure for a real app. We're just reproducing the pages described in the [frontend instructions](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit/blob/master/FRONTEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md). If you start to work on a page, please open a issue, specifing the page. This guide will be modified as the state of the app changes, if you stay out for a while and feels confused, remember to look here.
