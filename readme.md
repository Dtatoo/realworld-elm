# Volunteers Needed!
There's very little code here now, and we need you to help get this project off the ground. This project will join the ranks of React/Redux and Angular in the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) tutorial. If you love Elm and want to help it reach its potential as platform for developing realtime, interactive applications in the browser, join us! Take a look at our [contributing guide](contributing.md).
You can join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/realworld-dev/elm) or in the `#realworld` channel on [slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).

> ### Elm codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Elm** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Elm** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

Still building the app. Take a look at the [contributing guide](contributing.md).

# Getting started

> yarn install
> yarn build

After building run the `elm-reactor` and open the file `src/app/index.html`, just opening `Main.elm` wont load the css.
> elm-reactor
